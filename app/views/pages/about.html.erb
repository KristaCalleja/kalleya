        <p>This app was created by Josef Kalleya's youngest grandchild, Krista Calleja, who has very fond memories of her paternal grandfather: 'In-Nannu'. Eighty-seven years his junior, she was too young to understand the depth of her grandfather's philosophical musings. 
        <br><br>Contributions to this app were made by the family and friends of the artist.
